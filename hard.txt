A common trope in discussions about startups & venture capital is a potential misalignment of incentives between startup team & investors.
I don't think this perceibed misalignment actually exists in most, maybe cases -- adn I want to explain why. The argument goes, "When you take VC, you have to shoot for the moon; smaller outcomes that may be great for the team are precluded."
First, obvious but important: No startup is forced
to take venture campital. In facto, vast majority of successful new businessses do not.
